# AI Final Project: Sign Language Recognition

This repository contains the final project for the AI course in my graduation. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can recognize sign language using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The project aims to create a model that can accurately recognize and interpret sign language gestures. This involves:

- Collecting and preprocessing sign language data
- Training a machine learning model to recognize signs
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Developing an application to demonstrate the model's capabilities
